interesting finds:

- a lot of backdoors...

### directory enumuration

dirb
dirbuster
gobuster


### SMB enumeration

use metasploit
scanner/smb/smb_version
![[Pasted image 20240716190356.png]]

smb has anonymous login... but no useful info for now.
could connect to smb ipc share with anonymous login.


### ssh enumeration 

unable to negotiable 
-oKexAlgorithms=+....
no matching cipher found
-c ...

try connecting without password possible banner.


## Researching Potential Vulnerabilities 

in order:
port 80,443
port 139 smb
ssh - very unlikely

80/443 potentially vulnerable to openFuck
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764
https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck
This Exploit (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764/) is outdated.

139 - samba 2.2.1a is potentially vulnerable to trans2open
https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/

### searchsploit - great for looking at exploit-db database
/usr/share/exploitdb/ - exploits stored

## Nessus result analysis 

![[Pasted image 20240717183804.png]]

Insufficient patching, really insufficient 

In a report:
cover the most important ones, and export the nessus scan, convert it to a excel and give it to the client.

**never trust it blindly, always research it before submitting it**
